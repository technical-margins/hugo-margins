# Hugo Margins

A test repository for experimenting with Hugo as a static site generator, primarily focused on setting up the environment, configuring the **Docsy** theme module, and exploring multilingual support. Blog content is used as placeholder material to test the configuration, but the emphasis is on Hugo’s setup and functionality.

## About

This project serves as a sandbox for testing Hugo’s features and setup configurations, using Docsy as theme. While blog content is currently being used as placeholder material, the goal is to assess Hugo’s potential for technical documentation sites.

## Features

The main focus of this repository is on:

- **Site Setup**: Exploring and refining Hugo’s configurations, content structure, and theme integration.
- **Theme Integration**: Testing the Docsy theme module to understand its layout, styling, and content management capabilities.
- **Multilingual Support**: Experimenting with Hugo’s multilingual capabilities to support content in multiple languages, as offered by the Docsy theme’s default configurations.
- **Basic Docsy Content**: Using the example site content provided by Docsy as a baseline to explore layout and structure options.

### Future Plans

Once the setup is fine-tuned, future experiments may include:

- **Technical Documentation Content**: Replacing blog content with technical writing content as placeholder material to simulate a documentation site.
- **Additional Hugo Features**: Exploring Hugo’s advanced features to further customise the site’s functionality for technical content.

## Repository Structure

Overview of key files and directories:

- `content/` - Contains markdown files for testing with placeholder content, which may be replaced with documentation material in the future.
- `layouts/` - Custom layouts and partials for specific structural needs, if required.
- `assets/` and `resources/` - Static files such as images, which support content presentation.
- `hugo.yaml` - Main configuration file for Hugo, where settings for multilingual support and theme integration are defined.
- `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yaml` - Docker configuration files for local development and consistent environments.
- Serving command: `npm run serve`

## Theme: Docsy

This project uses the [Docsy theme](https://www.docsy.dev/) as a Hugo module. Docsy is tailored for technical documentation and supports multilingual content, providing a robust base for experimenting with a documentation-focused site.
