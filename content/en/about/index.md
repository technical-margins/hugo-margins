## Background and approach

My background combines linguistics and technical expertise, allowing me to serve effectively as a bridge between product teams, R&D and various stakeholders. I balance editorial quality with technical accuracy to create documentation that truly addresses user needs.

The [portfolio](../portfolio/) section showcases practical examples of my methodological approach to technical documentation.
