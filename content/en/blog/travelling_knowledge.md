People often speak of "knowledge management," but what exactly are we managing? The DIKW pyramid (*Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom*) reminds us of an essential distinction. Data is the raw land, the uncultivated plot – undeniable potential, but impractical as it stands. Then comes information, the bearer of intent. This, I believe, is where my role as a technical writer takes root. We are the ones who prepare the ground. We clear, select and classify the seeds of information, then sow them in an orderly fashion in prepared spaces (documentation, user interfaces...) so they have a chance to sprout.

But a seed, however carefully planted, is not yet a plant. And information, however well organised, is not knowledge. Knowledge only comes to life when users bring the vital elements: the water of experience, the light of reflection. It's their engagement that allows the seed to germinate and the young shoot to grow. The flowering of understanding belongs to them, far beyond the simple provision of plots and seedlings that we ensure.

However, while our role focuses on preparing and making seeds available, we mustn't lose sight of the shifting essence of knowledge itself. For once an idea has germinated somewhere – within an individual, within a team – its true richness lies in its ability to travel, adapt, and transform when it encounters new environments. It's this dynamic I wish to explore here.

## Knowledge in Quarantine / The Deceptive Calm of the Island

When a team or company operates in isolation, its knowledge becomes an insular flora: adapted to its small territory, but dangerously specialised. Ideas end up treading the same familiar paths, creating a comfortable labyrinth where the horizon is lost. The risk? A gentle intellectual sclerosis, where innovation is reduced to polishing the same pebbles over and over again.

This drift contrasts with certain consciously insular approaches, notably that often associated with Japan. There, the national narrative values a supposed ability to absorb ideas from the mainland, not to passively submit to them, but to dissect, filter, and reinvent them through a distinct cultural prism. A myth, perhaps, but revealing of a dynamic of active adaptation.

In the absence of such a process, a closed ecosystem can become vulnerable. Its balance then depends on what is missing. Ireland, famously free of snakes, illustrates how a specific absence can weaken a system. Hypothetically, introducing an external element, one that is naturally regulated elsewhere, could cause a sudden imbalance. Similarly, an intellectual ecosystem shielded from any critical confrontation risks slowly suffocating, then collapsing at the first shock.

## The Cultural Shock of Ideas / Unexpected Catalysts

It's often in these moments of collision, when knowledge steps out of its comfort zone, that the greatest transformations are born. When an idea conceived for one sector meets the constraints of another. When a tried-and-tested method confronts different working habits. These points of friction do not necessarily destroy: they transform, catalyse, reinvent.

A classic example illustrates this well: in China, explosive powder was originally used both for religious purposes (fireworks) and for limited military applications. Carried westward along the Silk Roads, it wasn't simply copied; it was repurposed, adapted, amplified, eventually becoming the driving force behind major military innovations that shifted the balance of power. Transfers are never neutral: they provoke unforeseen metamorphoses.

Similarly, the invention of administrative paper, also born in China, transformed in Europe into a tool of intellectual revolution. It's never the same plant that grows: the seed travels, but it's the soil that gives it its final form.

## Sowing, Sharing, Growing / Cultivating Collective Intelligence

Welcoming "travelling knowledge" is no trivial matter. It is not enough to fling open the windows to the four winds of ideas.

Regular exposure to the new is essential: listening at conferences, exploring professional networks, maintaining vigilant awareness, immersing oneself in new training. This is how we capture initial inspiration and bring back these seeds from elsewhere in our nets.

But the real work only begins afterwards: how do we acclimatise these seeds? How do we help them take root so they benefit everyone? Letting each team experiment alone risks multiplying redundant trials, leaving everyone constantly stumbling over the same obstacles. The challenge is to organise a rapid circulation of learnings: disseminating successes, but above all, sharing failures to avoid endlessly repeating the same mistakes. It's this transparency of experimentation that transforms individual effort into collective intelligence.

Thus, through discussions, trials, and adjustments, the idea from elsewhere shapes itself to our local realities. Some will take deep root, others will simply enrich the landscape with their temporary strangeness.

## Cultivating the Knowledge Landscape / Beyond Simple Storage

Knowledge management isn't so much about stockpiling reserves or running a warehouse. It's about cultivating a living and diverse landscape, where established knowledge coexists with new seeds brought by the winds from outside. The richness lies not in pure local robustness, but in the ability to integrate difference.

An organisation that knows how to welcome these travelling seeds, to acclimatise them, and to let unexpected hybrids thrive, can thus enrich its soil and strengthen its own growth.

Knowledge management then becomes a patient work of horticulture: preparing the ground, encouraging promising hybrids, spotting invasive species, and safeguarding the overall balance. Not to freeze a perfect garden, but to maintain an ecosystem capable of flowering, mutating and withstanding storms.

*Remain a gardener of the living, always ready to welcome what is not yet foreseen.*

It's precisely through this process that these reflections came to me. Stepping out of my daily role, breathing the air of the Documation trade fair, engaging in stimulating internal discussions on *Knowledge Management*, and immersing myself in readings on the subject... all perfectly illustrated how "pollens" from elsewhere can enrich our own little garden. And it's to develop this idea that I undertook to write this article.
