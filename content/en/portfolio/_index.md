This section showcases examples of documentation I've produced. As I can't share my professional work, I've used the MkDocs version of this website – as opposed to the current Hugo version – as a representative example.

## Documentation Philosophy

I draw inspiration from the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework, without applying it rigidly, and from [The Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/) templates to ensure clarity and quality.

* **[Tutorial](./tutorial.md)**: Step-by-step guides designed to help beginners learn through practice
* **How-to guide**: Instructions for solving specific problems
* **Explanation**: Explanations to help understand concepts or choices
* **Reference**: Precise technical descriptions of systems or configurations

My aim is to produce documentation that is simple, useful and accessible, adapted to each project and its readers.
