*Hugo Margins* is a companion to *Technical Margins*, exploring a different approach to static site generation. While Technical Margins uses MkDocs, this project implements the **Hugo** architecture and features of the **Docsy** theme.

This site serves as both an experimental platform and a practical example. It allows me to explore Hugo's specific content structure, its customisation mechanisms, and the integration of complex components in a technical documentation environment.

The site is organised into several main sections: [Portfolio](./portfolio/), [Blog](./blog/) and [About](./about/). It also offers a multilingual experience (English, [French](./fr/) and [Chinese](./zh/)), although the Portfolio section is currently only available in English and French. Please note that the language selector is not accessible on mobile devices due to a known limitation of the Docsy theme.

I may occasionally share a few thoughts here.

A minimal space for testing â€“ no aim for regular publishing.

Welcome to those who stumble across this site, it remains a modest sandbox.
