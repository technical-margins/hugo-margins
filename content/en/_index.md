*Hugo Margins* is, above all, a space for technical experimentation, where I explore static site generators, this time using **Hugo** and its modular ecosystem. This project also gives me the opportunity to deepen my understanding of content structuring, Git submodules, and the features offered by the **Docsy** theme.

Although this site is publicly accessible, it is primarily a **testing ground**, rather than a polished reading space.

Welcome to those who stumble across this site, it remains a modest sandbox.
